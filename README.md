# LeoBirthday

I had 5 hours to create an app allowing my brother to guess his birthday's gift. 5 hours is really short and I had to go to the essential. Because i wanted him to guess on his smartphone, I have developped the whole app on responsive on Iphone 6/7/8. As a result, please adapt your browser to enjoy he project :) 

The app is 100% french and online with Firebase. You can see it here : https://leo-birthday-2.web.app/

Enjoy ! :)

PS : He really loved it.
